It seems like everyone is afraid of AI completely taking over the job of software engineers. Everyone, except real engineers. I’ve watched countless podcasts and read articles from people “warning us” about AI. While there are some valid points about ensuring the safe development of the technology, we need to read between the lines to get to the real purpose behind these warnings.

I know, this article was supposed to be about the advantages of learning software engineering — not another discussion on the AI existential crisis, right? You’re right. We’ll get into that more in another article. For now, just remember that when someone has a pessimistic or doomsday view of AI, you can recognize the real potential and limitations of the technology and use it to improve your life.

When I talk about software engineering, I mean understanding the concepts that make software possible. If you understand why a web application works, every user interface is just an abstraction of the actual solution. This is how we’ve approached every system in human history. We started with cars that only mechanics could operate. Now, you don’t even have to think about the clutch because we’ve reduced the complexity so much that anyone can drive.

The best example? Computers. Who would have imagined you’d carry the world’s knowledge in a pocket-sized device and be able to instantly communicate with anyone around the globe? Smartphones represent centuries of scientific and computational advancements, yet now, anyone can use them without any technical understanding. That’s real abstraction.

Think about this: At work, you use a set of software tools for business operations. You pay your bills with digital money, and you communicate with loved ones over the internet. We’ve created a new reality governed by binary code, and those who understand how it works have a clear advantage in society.

Thinking this knowledge can only be gained through formal education is a mistake. In fact, software is one of the only subjects you can learn and practice in the same place: a computer with an internet connection.

Here’s how understanding technology can improve your life.

If you have a business and want to leverage the internet to boost sales, you need to know SEO, digital marketing, or paid advertising. These concepts are built on a foundation of technology. Social media algorithms function in specific ways, and understanding them allows you to stand out and generate leads. Organic traffic is driven by ranking high in search engines for certain keywords. Paid advertising becomes more effective when you target specific audiences and use solid sales funnels with A/B testing. And yes, a sales funnel requires web development to build landing pages.

The more you understand technology, the more leverage you have. Simple.

Here’s another great example that has helped me while working with clients: Every business has its own way of doing things — this is called their tech stack. I felt confident suggesting improvements because, even if I wasn’t familiar with their specific software, all CRMs accomplish the same goal. There are only two outcomes: either the software already has the functionality they need, or we can code it and integrate it into their system.

You might think that if you’re not in a technical role, you can skip this knowledge. That’s a mistake. If you’re not using LLMs to enhance your productivity, you’re not leveraging technology, and you’ll be left behind when the masses adopt it.

You don’t have to be a programmer or a Linux hacker living in the terminal. But to stay ahead, you need a solid foundation in computing. That’s the unfair advantage in today’s world. Society has evolved, and now binary code is part of its DNA.
