***Actionable steps. No B.S.***

This is everything I've learned from working with businesses across a variety of industries. It will apply to your business because it's based on the fundamentals.

Every single action in the funnel should serve one of these two purposes: it either generates traffic or converts people.

Anything else is a distraction.

We'll talk about:

---
* Who you are selling to.

* Traffic generation.

* Lead magnets.

* Conversion mechanisms.

* Systems.
---

Let's start at the top of the funnel where no one knows who you are.

## Building Knowledge on Solid Foundations:

Aristotle always emphasized the importance of establishing a solid foundation of basic principles to build knowledge.

This is no exception.

The first principle is knowing who you are talking to. If this isn't well established from the beginning, then your lead magnets, your content, or any other form of attraction won't work because the message doesn't resonate with these people.

The best way to construct your avatar is by understanding what your offer solves and delving deeper into the psychology of this person.

What are their struggles? What are their desires? What obstacles constrain their goals?

You need to have this clear, because everything you create is with this person in mind.

## Defining Your Audience:

You have your avatar defined. This is 50% of the job.

I once worked with a business loan broker who offered every kind of loan you can imagine: MCA, SBA, lines of credit, etc. These products have different avatars because certain business profiles match with a specific loan.

Once we defined the type of business they wanted to serve, creating the message became much easier.
I explained the whole process in detail in this [Reddit post:](https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAlegend/comments/1bcw0me/how_to_never_run_out_of_mca_leads/)


## Traffic Generation:

Now, at the top of the funnel, there are only four ways to get more eyeballs on your business:

* Paid Ads

* Cold Outreach

* Content Creation

* Referrals

You can do something with all of them. If you're not, that's either an excuse or you lack the capital.
Then, we have to invest more time.

Always ask yourself: How can I automate this process? Do this before hiring an agency or contractor.
But regardless of the method, there should be a clear Call-to-Action to help this person advance in the funnel.

Let's break down each strategy.

All the paid advertising campaigns I've done are through Facebook ads.

Regardless of the platform, you should hammer this into your head:

If the campaign is not converting, it's not because the algorithm doesn't like you. It's because the campaign sucks.

We need to find what it is... Is it the copy? The creative? The targeting? The landing page?
Then we have to iterate and test until we find the winning ad. But once your ads start popping up, I suggest you strap in because your numbers will skyrocket.

Just make sure you have a good ratio between CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) and LTV (Lifetime Value). That is the only metric that matters in the big picture.

## Cold Outreach and Content Creation:

I don't personally like cold outreach, but that doesn't mean it doesn't work.

In fact, there are companies making millions while still having a cold outreach strategy.

My go-to method is cold emailing, which is relatively inexpensive depending on the number of domains you purchase.

Just like with paid ads, it needs constant testing to find which email gets more replies and conversions.

Make sure you buy a reliable list of emails that match your avatar's profile and an offer they really need. The quality of the list determines whether your campaign is successful or not.

Creating content is the most powerful strategy ever. It's a long-term play for building your online reputation.

It opens so many opportunities for your business and personal brand that you can't imagine.
The first rejection I've gotten from business owners is that they don't feel comfortable being on camera.

Or even worse, they think they are good on camera, but in reality, they are objectively bad. That's why, from a business perspective, the best form of content you can create is newsletters. 

People don't really connect with the brand; they connect with the people representing the brand.
Unless you have a content creation team, someone who scripts your videos and ghostwrites for you, then a newsletter is your best option.

It's the only place where you can educate your audience about your offer and promote the offer itself at the same time. Truly amazing.

## Lead Magnets and Conversion:

The goal here is to generate as much traffic as we possibly can to our business, making people aware that we exist.

This leads us to the next step, which is lead magnets, but not the traditional advice. You don't really want to follow the old advice.

The way I see lead magnets is as an opportunity to set a high standard for your business. Something that makes anyone think, "If this is the free version, I can't imagine what the paid version is like."
It's an opportunity to innovate and provide value first before asking for anything in return.

Amazing and high-converting lead magnets can be a product by themselves.

The blueprint I follow to create them involves taking a portion of the main offer, or even sometimes the whole offer, and creating something valuable with it.

Sure, you can still create eBooks, PDFs, and webinars. But there are mainly two that I have implemented that have generated good results.

* Email courses and web applications.

Email courses, if done correctly, are an autopilot converting machine. You educate and provide value while promoting your solutions at the same time.

Web applications are very powerful as well.

I was working with a water filtration company (by the way, take care of your testosterone and avoid plastic) and I created a couple of lead magnets. One of those is a web app that will tell you the quality of your water if you provide your address.

It will check the water quality in your town, and if the water is bad, it will give you the email course to fix the quality of your water where the services of this company will be promoted.
The point is to get creative and build more trust in the prospect's journey throughout the funnel.

## Conversion Mechanisms:

It's time to print some Bitcoins... I mean cash...

Conversion mechanisms should be very straightforward, and they will vary depending on the nature of your offer.

But there is a rule you should follow: make it simple. Only two options when they visit your landing page: They pay or leave.

No one cares about the 'about us' section on your website. Don't overthink it.

That's why directing your leads from paid campaigns directly to a landing page without a Video Sales Letter (VSL) isn't a good idea. Based on my testing, sending them to a lead magnet, building trust, and then promoting the offer in the lead magnets have played well.

The lead magnets always need to have a clear CTA to your checkout page. Good copywriting will smoothly mention your offer in your emails and website and convert well.

Make it simple. Marketers complicate funnels with crazy bifurcations and possible outcomes. Do A/B testing, see what works, double down on what is working.

## Systems and Automation:

Finally, this requires a system.

For everything, I use Go High Level (not sponsored by them). You can do everything from there except for cold outreach.

Set up effective email sequences based on specific customer actions and automate as much as you can.

For brick-and-mortar businesses I've worked with, SMS has proven to be very effective as well.

I've only scratched the surface, but I wanted to give you a general overview of what has worked for the businesses where I've implemented this approach.

I hope you find value in this. Like it and share; if you have any questions, shoot me a DM.
Have a great day and keep it up!
