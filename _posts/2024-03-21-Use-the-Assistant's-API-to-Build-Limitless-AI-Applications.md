The value of implementing Large Language Models (LLM) in your business lies in creating tailor-made solutions for your specific context. Imagine being able to ask your AI about quarterly reports and discovering more efficient ways to optimize your expenses (Your financial department would love it). The assistant's API facilitates the creation of these personalized solutions for your business, as it can be trained with your data in almost any file format, such as CSV, PDF, JSON, etc. I will guide you on how to develop these assistants and craft limitless applications by leveraging one of the most powerful features: function calling.

An assistant is essentially a model capable of running multiple tools in parallel. There are three functionalities that make the assistant adaptable to your needs: the code interpreter, knowledge retrieval, and function calling.

Code Interpreter: This feature enables your assistant to execute code within a controlled environment. If you upload a file to the assistant, it can process your data, regardless of format, and return a modified file based on your instructions. For example, if you submit a CSV file for data cleaning using pandas, you simply provide the model with the necessary instructions, and it will return the processed CSV file using sandboxed execution.

Knowledge Retrieval: This functionality allows your assistant to stand out by enabling you to upload files containing your data in various formats. Here are the supported file types you can upload to the assistant.

However, it's important to note that not all file types are supported for information retrieval. For instance, CSV files are not supported for retrieval, but you can convert a CSV file into JSON format to extract information from the file as if you were conversing with your spreadsheet. Of course you can implement a clandestine solution to this problem until OpenAI introduces CSV file retrieval support, but in the meantime, you can use this script.

Function Calling: This is where the real excitement begins. Imagine if your assistant could utilize your own tools, and those tools were APIs of other applications. That's precisely the capability provided by this functionality. I plan to dedicate a separate article to function calling in the future, as this feature truly differentiates your program from other custom GPT implementations.

Now that you're familiar with the tools available to assistants, it's time to learn how to create one. There's a straightforward framework you should understand:

* Create or load an assistant (The API incurs charges per assistant created, so instead of creating a new one each time, you can reload an existing one.)

* Create or load a thread.

* Compose a new message.

* Execute the thread with the assistant.

* Retrieve the result.

* Return the messages to the UI (My UI is the terminal until I master Flask.) 

In future discussions, I'll delve deeper into how I automate this process and integrate it into any business context. For comprehensive details and to start building your advanced application, you can check the official documentation here.
