The 4 levels of awareness in marketing are an important concept to understand.

But instead of boring strategies, let’s understand the journey of our customer and make it fun for them.

And for you as well!

Your business is one of the thousands of islands in the ocean of products and services. Your customers are navigating and looking for the best island to land on and forget about their problems.

Our job is to make this island as interesting and valuable as we can.

At this point, the prospect is unaware of your offer, or they don’t even know they have a problem.

We need to convert unawareness into awareness.

## 1. Unaware

I always like to think about each level as an opportunity to provide value. Each progression to the next layer means another chance to improve the prospect's experience.

Marketers call it lead magnets, phishers call it bait, and programmers call it open source.

At the end, it is about providing a free feature of your main service or product.
Content on social media is the best way to present the problems that you can solve. Talking about the pain points your ideal client faces in their life. I prefer to connect with them as a person rather than a customer.

At this level, we need frequency. We have to remind the world that we exist, and the only way to achieve this is to put ourselves out there daily.

## 2. Aware

We've got the attention of the prospect; we can’t miss this opportunity.
At this point, they are aware of the problem and are actively looking for a solution.

Here, we need to be more specific about our content. The majority of personal brands, unless they are very niche, talk about multiple topics; that's why it is a good idea to narrow down the message to the prospect by taking them to another place.

My go-to strategy that I’ve implemented lately with my clients is email courses.
There are various reasons why I like this, especially for the next layer.

## 3. Solution Aware

They have performed an action to learn more about your product/service.
If they subscribe to your email course, this is the best opportunity to, first, educate them about the product and position your offer, making it different from the market.

The pros of an email course are incredible. You can create email sequences that keep the prospect engaged, provide valuable content in your emails, and convert this course to video.

At the end of the course, the prospect is very aware of your offer, but they haven’t made any purchase yet.

Our job is to facilitate the next progression, and depending on the nature of your product, here’s where the salesperson comes into play. We can either schedule a video call and make a human connection with them.

## 4. Customer

This is not the end of the journey; it’s actually the start.

This is not the only purchase your customer will make from you, and you’re not going to offer the same product forever, right?

People who give me money are automatically part of the VIP section of my business. They get the best promotions, the first look at new products, and my support.

Customers are now part of a community that shares something in common: they all purchased from you! Let’s give them an even better experience.
This layer is the end of the prospect journey but the start of the customer journey. These are the people that fuel your business. This deserves its own analysis and strategies to increase the LTV (Lifetime Value) of the business and keep them engaged with you.
